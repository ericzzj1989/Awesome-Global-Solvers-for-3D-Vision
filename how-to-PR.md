### Format for Adding Papers

When adding a paper, modify the `README.md` and follow this format:
```markdown
- TITLE, *VENUE, YEAR*. [[Paper](link)] [[Code](link)] [[Project Page](link)]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
- GlobalPointer: Large-Scale Plane Adjustment with Bi-Convex Relaxation, *ECCV, 2024*. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13537)] [[Code](https://github.com/WU-CVGL/GlobalPointer)] [[Project Page](https://bangyan101.github.io/GlobalPointer/)]
```

### Guidelines

- **Title**: Use the exact title from the paper
- **Venue**: Include conference/journal name and year (e.g., *CVPR, 2024*)
- **Links**: 
  - Paper link should point to PDF if available (arXiv, OpenAccess, etc.)
  - Include Code and Project Page links if available
  - If code/project page doesn't exist, omit those tags
- **Placement**: Add the paper to the appropriate section based on method type or application

### Notes

- Not all papers need to have code or project page links
- Please verify that links are working before submitting
- For papers in multiple categories, add to the most relevant section
